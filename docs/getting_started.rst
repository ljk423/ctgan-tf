Welcome to the `ctgan-tf` documentation.

---------------
Getting started
---------------

Tensorflow 2.X implementation of a Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial
Network. CTGAN is a GAN-based data synthesizer that can "generate synthetic
tabular data with high fidelity".

This model was originally designed by the *Data to AI Lab at MIT* team, and
it was published in their NeurIPS paper `Modeling Tabular data using
Conditional GAN <https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00503>`_.

For more information regarding this work, and to access the original PyTorch
implementation provided by the authors,
please refer to their GitHub repository and their documentation:

* Documentation: https://sdv-dev.github.io/CTGAN
* Homepage: https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN

Install
-------

Requirements
